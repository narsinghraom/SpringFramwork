Maven:
it is a build tool. (BUilding the project with all relavent jars)
@-> Ant build tool (default for NetBeans IDE).
-> to build the project with external jar files, we need to manulally download and store 
in one location and that location we will configure in ant.xml

Maven: we will configure in POM.XML (Project Object Mapping)
-> maven itself have an repository. (Maven Repo)
-> In the Maven repository we have all the relavent jar files.
ex: spring IOC - 7 jars
Spring JDBC- 3 jars
MVC - 5 jars
-> Instead of downloading manually by ourself, if we configure in pom.xml automatically the
maven will download from maven repository and it will store in local drive
.m2 folder
-> what ever the jar file we need we will call it as dependency jar,
so all the dependecy jar files will be congigured in dependencies tag.
-> the dependency we will configure as 
*Artifact ID - class name or context name
*groupId  is nothing but an package
*version.
Please refer in https://mvnrepository.com/
Ex:  <dependencies>
<dependency>
<artifactId> Servlets</artifactId>
<group-Id> javax.servlet</group-Id>
<version>5.4</version>
<dependency>
</dependencies>
